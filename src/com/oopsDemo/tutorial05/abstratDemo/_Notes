TOPICS COVERED: Abstract Methods and Classes

An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract â€” it may or may not include abstract methods.
Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces,
and followed by a semicolon), like this: abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);

If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract, as in:

public abstract class GraphicObject {
   // declare fields
   // declare non-abstract methods
   abstract void draw();
}

When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the
abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.
