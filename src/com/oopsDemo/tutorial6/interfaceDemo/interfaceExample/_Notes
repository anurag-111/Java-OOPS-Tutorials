TOPICS COVERED : Interfaces

- Interface :

    An Interface is defined as an abstract type used to specify the behavior of a class.
    An interface in Java is a blueprint of a behaviour.
    A Java interface contains static constants and abstract methods.
    The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
    There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not the method body.
    It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

- Static Methods in Interfaces :

    In Java, until version 8, interfaces could only declare abstract methods, meaning
    they couldn't contain any implementation code. However, starting from Java 8,
    interfaces can also have static methods with a defined implementation.
    Here are the rules for static methods in interfaces:

        1. Declaration: Static methods in interfaces are declared using the static keyword.

        2. Method Body: Unlike regular interface methods, static methods have a defined
                        implementation within the interface itself. You can provide the
                        implementation directly in the interface, using the method body.

        3. Method Invocation: Static methods in interfaces are invoked using the interface
                              name followed by the method name, without creating an instance
                              of the interface.
